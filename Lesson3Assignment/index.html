    <h2>Collection Description</h2>
    
    <!-- This is where I insert the image of my collection. Also chose to add a border from something I read on Stack Overflow when I searched for cool image borders
      and also comments cause I knew how to do that-->
    <img src="gtrCollectios.jpg" alt="1/1 RARE GTR JDM Collection">

    <p>Sadly, I have to offer my <strong> 1/1 collection of Japanese Domestic Market Cars (JDM)</strong> for sale to cover my tuition expenses. In this collection, there are <em> six different </em> Skyline GTR's. The collection does not include the last GTS-R since that is my daily driver.</p>
    
    <p>In this collection is the 1/1 Paul Walker owned GTR. Also, two of the GTR's only have less than 20,000 miles. Three of these vehicles are also RHD (right hand drive). All of these vehicles are in <em>excellent condition</em> and have been regularly serviced/driven for usage purposes.</p>

    <h2>Behind the Collection</h2>
    <p>Over the span of 25 years, me and my father have collected JDM vehicles. These couple of JDM vehicles are the best of our entire collection. We personally met Paul Walker before he passed away and he even gave us ownership of his own GTR.

    <!-- here I add an unordered list of resons why its special collection -->
