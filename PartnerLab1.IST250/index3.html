        <p>
            The <strong>Sisyphus Collection</strong> was inspired by the Greek myth of Sisyphus, was a collection about <strong> struggle, repetition, and resistance.</strong> The collection featured dramatic, sculptural garments with exaggerated silhouettes, draped fabrics, and experimental shoes, embodying Sisyphus' endless, uphill battle of pushing a boulder up the mountain. Owens blended elements of dark, apocalyptic imagery with high fashion, projecting a double impression of strength and fatigue, which symbolizes the eternal struggle of the individual against the forces of society. The collection was a study of the perpetual quest for meaning in the face of inevitable defeat while projecting an image of untamed strength and beauty.

            This collection titled <strong>Phlegethon</strong> was inspired by the mythological river of fire in the underworld, representing <strong>purification, torment, and rebirth.</strong> The collection showcased striking, bold designs with textures reminiscent of molten metal, featuring asymmetrical cuts and fluid, dramatic silhouettes. Owens infused a dark, apocalyptic vibe, merging futuristic elements with ancient influences. The use of burnt and charred fabrics highlighted themes of destruction and transformation, while the intense color palette of reds, oranges, and blacks underscored the collection’s ties to the underworld and its fiery nature. The collection conveyed a sense of both vulnerability and strength, delving into the idea of emerging more resilient from adversity.
